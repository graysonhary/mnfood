        <p>Having spent a few years in the Twin Cities, I have found myself enjoying some wonderful meals with some wonderful company. All over the metro, there's something new cooking, just waiting to be found. This website, I hope, can be a resorce to friends, new and old, in discovering the culniary delight that the Twin Cities, and the rest of Minnesota, have to offer.</p>

        <span class="address">165 13th Ave NE, Minneapolis, MN 55413</span>
        <p>One of the best spots for pizza, salads, and cocktails in Minneapolis!</p>

        <span class="address">2124 Marshall St NE, Minneapolis, MN 55418</span>
        <p>An inconspicuous little building lies off Marshall street, not too far South of Lowry Avenue, nor too far from the ever popular Psycho Suzis. This little building is home to The Sample Room, one of, in my opinion, the less talked about spots in Northeast (or Minneapolis, for that matter). Playing host to a great bar program, and an even better food program, the burger (named after French explore, Pierre Bottineau), and their Cuban, are two of the best sandwiches available in town (in addition to what may be the best fries in town, too)!</p>
