  <p>An inconspicuous little building lies off Marshall street, not too far South of Lowry Avenue, nor too far from the ever popular Psycho Suzis. This little building is home to The Sample Room, one of, in my opinion, the less talked about spots in Northeast (or Minneapolis, for that matter). Playing host to a great bar program, and an even better food program, the burger (named after French explore, Pierre Bottineau), and their Cuban, are two of the best sandwiches available in town (in addition to what may be the best fries in town, too)!</p>
