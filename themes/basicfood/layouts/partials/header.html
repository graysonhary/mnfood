    <h1 class="bold">Minnesota Food</h1>
    <p>Having spent a few years in the Twin Cities, I have found myself enjoying some wonderful meals with wonderful people. All over the metro, there's something new cooking, just waiting to be found. This website, I hope, can be a resource to friends, new and old, in discovering the culinary delight that the Twin Cities, and the rest of Minnesota, have to offer.</p>
